This is a test file located in a test Git repository.
If you cloned this repository, it is saved locally - that means
changes other people make won't appear here. If changes are made
to this file after cloning/pulling and you want to keep those changes,
then you must "commit" and "push" them.
'''

Type your name below. Then, try to add, commit, and push your changes.
Remember to "pull" changes before "pushing". Actions should be taken in the order:
    0.) Save changes to this file (locally)
    1.) "Add" aka "Stage" changes
    2.) "Commit" changes (be sure to add a commit message!)
    3.) "Pull" changes from others
    3 1/2.) If needed, work through merge conflicts. However, that shouldn't
            be necessary here.
    4.) "Push" changes to remote repo
